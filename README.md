# Scrap Robot

## Background Of The Problem
Due to the frequent use of metal, metal parts are dumped unnecessarily. This makes recycling initiatives challenging since they involve collecting scrap metal parts from dump sites and transporting them to pickup centers, where appropriate personnel will collect them and forward them to the right place for sorting and recycling.

## Problem Statement
Scrap collection is a hazardous activity for humans to undertake due to the nature of metal, which can easily damage a personâ€™s skin. Therefore, the vision of this project is to develop a robot that collects scrap metal in a designated area and transports the collected scrap to a designated pickup center.
