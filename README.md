# Scrap Robot

## Background Of The Problem
Due to the frequent use of metal, metal parts are dumped unnecessarily. This makes recycling initiatives hard since such initiatives involve collecting the dumped scrap metal parts into pickup centers from where the appropriate personnel will pick it from and forward it to the right place to be sorted out and recycled.

## Problem Statement
Scrap collection is a hazardous activity for humans to undertake due to the nature of metal, which can easily damage a personâ€™s skin. Therefore, the vision of this project is to develop a robot that takes care of collecting scrap metal in a given area and placing the collected scrap in a defined pickup center.
